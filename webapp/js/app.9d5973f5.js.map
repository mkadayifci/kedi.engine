Object v1.66\r\n\r\n  (c) Norbert Landsteiner 2003-2015\r\n  mass:werk - media environments\r\n  <http://www.masswerk.at/termlib/>\r\n\r\n  Creates [multiple] Terminal instances.\r\n\r\n  Synopsis:\r\n\r\n  myTerminal = new Terminal(<config object>);\r\n  myTerminal.open();\r\n\r\n  <config object> overrides any values of object `TerminalDefaults'.\r\n  individual values of `id' must be supplied for multiple terminals.\r\n  `handler' specifies a function to be called for input handling.\r\n  (see `Terminal.prototype.defaultHandler()' and documentation.)\r\n\r\n  globals defined in this library:\r\n  \tTerminal           (Terminal object)\r\n    TerminalDefaults   (default configuration)\r\n    termDefaultHandler (default command line handler)\r\n    TermGlobals        (common vars and code for all instances)\r\n    termKey            (named mappings for special keys)\r\n    termDomKeyRef      (special key mapping for DOM constants)\r\n\r\n  (please see the v. 1.4 history entry on these elements)\r\n\r\n  required CSS classes for font definitions: \".term\", \".termReverse\".\r\n\r\n  Compatibilty:\r\n  Standard web browsers with a JavaScript implementation compliant to\r\n  ECMA-262 2nd edition and support for the anonymous array and object\r\n  constructs and the anonymous function construct in the form of\r\n  \"myfunc=function(x) {}\" (c.f. ECMA-262 3rd edion for details).\r\n  This comprises almost all current browsers but Konquerer (khtml) and\r\n  versions of Apple Safari for Mac OS 10.0-10.28 (Safari 1.0) which\r\n  lack support for keyboard events.\r\n  v1.5: Dropped support of Netscape 4 (layers)\r\n\r\n  License:\r\n  This JavaScript-library is free.\r\n  Include a visible backlink to <http://www.masswerk.at/termlib/> in the\r\n  embedding web page or application.\r\n  The library should always be accompanied by the 'readme.txt' and the\r\n  sample HTML-documents.\r\n  \r\n  Any changes should be commented and must be reflected in `Terminal.version'\r\n  in the format: \"Version.Subversion (compatibility)\".\r\n  \r\n  Donations:\r\n  Donations are welcome: You may support and/or honor the development of\r\n  \"termlib.js\" via PayPal at: <http://www.masswerk.at/termlib/donate/>\r\n\r\n  Disclaimer:\r\n  This software is distributed AS IS and in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

No use of\r\n  the product is authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.\r\n\r\n  ### The sections above must not be removed. ###\r\n  \r\n  version 1.01: added Terminal.prototype.resizeTo(x,y)\r\n                added Terminal.conf.fontClass (=> configureable class name)\r\n                Terminal.prototype.open() now checks for element conf.termDiv\r\n                in advance and returns success.\r\n\r\n  version 1.02: added support for <TAB> and Euro sign\r\n                (Terminal.conf.printTab, Terminal.conf.printEuro)\r\n                and a method to evaluate printable chars:\r\n                Terminal.prototype.isPrintable(keycode)\r\n\r\n  version 1.03: added global keyboard locking (TermGlobals.keylock)\r\n                modified Terminal.prototype.redraw for speed (use of locals)\r\n\r\n  version 1.04: modified the key handler to fix a bug with MSIE5/Mac\r\n                fixed a bug in TermGlobals.setVisible with older MSIE-alike\r\n                browsers without DOM support.\r\n\r\n  version 1.05: added config flag historyUnique.\r\n \r\n  version 1.06: fixed CTRl+ALT (Windows alt gr) isn't CTRL any more\r\n                fixed double backspace bug for Safari;\r\n                added TermGlobals.setDisplay for setting style.display props\r\n                termlib.js now outputs lower case html (xhtml compatibility)\r\n\r\n  version 1.07: added method rebuild() to rebuild with new color settings.\r\n\r\n  version 1.1:  fixed a bug in 'more' output mode (cursor could be hidden after\r\n                quit)\r\n                added socket-extension for server-client talk in a separate file\r\n                -> \"temlib_socket.js\" (to be loaded after termlib.js)\r\n                (this is a separate file because we break our compatibility\r\n                guide lines with this IO/AJAX library.)\r\n\r\n  version 1.2   added color support (\"%[+-]c(<color>)\" markup)\r\n                moved paste support from sample file to lib\r\n                * TermGlobals.insertText( <text>)\r\n                * TermGlobals.importEachLine( <text> )\r\n                * TermGlobals.importMultiLine( <text> )\r\n\r\n  version 1.3   added word wrapping to write()\r\n                * activate with myTerm.wrapOn()\r\n                * deactivate with myTerm.wrapOff()\r\n                use conf.wrapping (boolean) for a global setting\r\n\r\n  version 1.4   Terminal is now an entirely self-contained object\r\n                Global references to inner objects for backward compatipility:\r\n                * TerminalDefaults   => Terminal.prototype.Defaults\r\n                * termDefaultHandler => Terminal.prototype.defaultHandler\r\n                * termKey            => Terminal.prototype.globals.termKey\r\n                                        see also: Terminal.prototype.termKey\r\n                * TermGlobals        => Terminal.prototype.globals\r\n                * termDomKeyRef      => Terminal.prototype.globals.termDomKeyRef\r\n\r\n                So in effect to outside scripts everything remains the same;\r\n                no need to rewrite any existing scripts.\r\n                You may now use \"this.globals\" inside any handlers\r\n                to refer to the static global object (TermGlobals).\r\n                You may also refer to key definitions as \"this.termKey.*\".\r\n                (Please mind that \"this.termKey\" is a reference to the static object\r\n                and not specific to the instance. A change to \"this.termKey\" will be\r\n                by any other instances of Terminal too.)\r\n                \r\n                Added method TermGlobals.assignStyle() for custom styles & mark up.\r\n                \r\n                Unified the color mark up: You may now use color codes (decimal or hex)\r\n                inside brackets. e.g.: %c(10)DARKRED%c() or %c(a)DARKRED%c()\r\n                \r\n                Added key repeat for remapped keys (cursor movements etc).\r\n\r\n  version 1.41  fixed a bug in the word wrapping regarding write() output, when\r\n                the cursor was set with cursorSet() before.\r\n\r\n  version 1.42  fixed a bug which caused Opera to delete 2 chars at once.\r\n                introduced property Terminal.isOpera (Boolean)\r\n\r\n  version 1.43  enhanced the control handler so it also catches ESC if flag closeOnESC\r\n                is set to false. fixed a bug with Safari which fired repeated events\r\n                for the control handler for TAB if flag printTab was set to false.\r\n\r\n  version 1.5   Changed the license.\r\n                Dropped support for Netscape 4 (layers).\r\n                HTML-elements are now created by document.createElement, if applicable.\r\n                Included the formerly separate socket extension in the main library.\r\n                Added methods 'backupScreen()' and 'restoreScreen()' to save a screen\r\n                and restore it's content from backup. (see the globbing sample).\r\n\r\n  version 1.51  Added basic support of ANSI-SGR-sequences.\r\n\r\n  version 1.52  Added method swapBackup(), reorganized some of the accompanying files.\r\n\r\n  version 1.54  Fixed BACK_SPACE for Chrome, DELETE for Safari/WebKit.\r\n\r\n  version 1.55  Fixed dead keys issue for Mac OS (Leapard & later), vowels only.\r\n  version 1.56  Fixed new ESC issue for Safari.\r\n  version 1.57  Fixed dead keys fix: now only for Safari/Mac, German (de-de).\r\n  version 1.59  Dropped dead keys fix, fixed backspace for Safari.\r\n  version 1.6   Saved some bytes by discarding traces of ancient condition syntax\r\n                Added input mode \"fieldMode\"\r\n  version 1.61  Changes to defaults implementation of the constructor.\r\n  version 1.62  Fixed a bug related to AltGr-sequences with IE8+.\r\n  version 1.65  Added options for textColor and textBlur.\r\n  version 1.66  textBlur accepts also an array of values for multiple text-shadows.\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\nconst Terminal = function (conf) {\r\n    if (typeof conf != 'object') conf = new Object();\r\n    for (var i in this.Defaults) {\r\n        if (typeof conf[i] ==
